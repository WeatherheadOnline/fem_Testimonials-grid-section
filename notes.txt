Let's get some practice at SASS. How about learning to incorporate multiple .sass files. 

I used @import but it warned that it was getting deprecated. I was directed to:
https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/import/

Added _attribution.sass, to isolate the attribution styles. 
Added _colors.sass, so that I can use the same color variables in both main.sass and _attribution.sass.
Added _sizing, for spacing variables and text-preset rules.

Added HTML structure: Looked at the design file and sketched out the structure I wanted for each testimonial card:
      <div class="box">
        <div class="box-author-wrapper">
          <div class="box-author-image"></div>
          <div class="box-author-text">
            <div class="box-author-name"></div>
            <div class="box-author-note"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="box-quote-main"></div>
        <div class="box-quote-expound"></div>
      </div>

These cards all follow the same formula. -> use JS to compile them from an array of testimonial objects.
