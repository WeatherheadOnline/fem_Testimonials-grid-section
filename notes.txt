Let's get some practice at SASS. How about learning to incorporate multiple .sass files. 

I used @import but it warned that it was getting deprecated. I was directed to:
https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/import/

Added _attribution.sass, to isolate the attribution styles. 
Added _colors.sass, so that I can use the same color variables in both main.sass and _attribution.sass.
Added _sizing, for spacing variables and text-preset rules.
https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/

Added HTML structure: Looked at the design file and sketched out the structure I wanted for each testimonial card:

      <div class="box">
        <div class="box-author-wrapper">
          <div class="box-author-image"></div>
          <div class="box-author-text">
            <div class="box-author-name"><p></p></div>
            <div class="box-author-note"><p></p></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="box-quote-main"><p></p></div>
        <div class="box-quote-expound"><p></p></div>
      </div>

These cards all follow the same formula. -> use JS to compile them from an array of testimonial objects.

Started by building out an array of testimonial objects. The five pieces of info that needed to be filled in for each one were: the person's name; the note under their name; file path for their profile pic; first quote; and longer quote. Used these as keys.
* de-tabbed the provided text to avoid extra spaces being added

Tested out printing each person's name to the screen. Then worked on getting the JS to print out the rest of the needed HTML. Built a template literal string based on the HTML template, incorporating the info from the array (by iterating over the array).
- Yay! it builds cards correctly! Now for styling.
- At first, the pics weren't showing up. Then I remembered to add inline HTML background-images in the template literal in the JS.

Added all new HTML class names from JS into SASS.

Added theme classes for text and background colors

Figured out how to implement @use and @forward

Applied theme colors and text-presets to boxes

Added grid layouts for mobile, tablet and desktop.
Added elements' padding and margin based on Figma file. For spacing between elements within each card, I set all text elements to `margin: 0` and used flex gaps for spacing.

Added the drop-shadow based on the figures in the Figma file (except I used the given color at 50% opacity instead of their 25% because that made the page look much closer to the design).

For mobile screens, I'm sizing the font based on viewport width -> also sizing the image in vw units so that it resizes with the text next to it.

Now that styles are done for mobile, I'm doing the wider desktop screen layout next. Verified that media queries are working for font sizes. Set a fixed width for the main wrapper ("testimonials"). Adjusted the row-gap size based on the Figma file.
